# CO2 Monitor as a Wall Clock
### Proper airing reduces risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection

## Background
“Aerosols are a possible transmission path of the novel coronavirus. Aerosols spread quickly throughout the entire room, especially in closed indoor spaces. Regular ventilation by shock and cross ventilation or via ventilation systems can significantly reduce the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2” [1]

Every person is emitting CO2 as well as aerosols while breathing. CO2 concentration correlates with the aerosol and thus virus concentration. CO2 is also a good indicator for the efficiency of the ventilation.
